maximumNumberOfConcurrentConnections: count
	"Set the maximum number of concurrent connections that I will accept.
	When this threshold is reached, a 503 Service Unavailable response will be sent
	and the connection will be closed. This protects me from certain forms of attacks.
	It is possible to raise this number when other system parameters are adjusted as well."

accessing response
contents 
	"Answer the contents or HTTP payload of the last response, 
	assuming the current request was executed.
	If I have a contentReader, it will be used to compute the contents.
	Otherwise I delegate to ZnResponse>>#contents, unless I am #streaming,
	in which case I return the stream of the streaming entity."
